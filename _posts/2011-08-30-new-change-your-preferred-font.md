Now you can save a preferred font for your account. It'll show up when you're previewing themes, and when you download them too.

To change your preferred font, first [log in or register](http://studiostyl.es/users/login). Then edit your details by clicking your name or user ID at the top right of the page. You'll see a couple of fields to change your preferred font.

I've put 3 common monospace fonts in the drop-down, but I know that won't satisfy you—you can choose “Other...” and type in absolutely any font you want. Comic Sans MS, anyone?

It'll only work if you have the font installed on your computer, otherwise you'll make everything look quite bad :)
