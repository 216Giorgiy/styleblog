Just over a week ago I uploaded Studio Styles to my web hosting account, emailed a few people about the new website, and went to bed. I was happy to get the experiment launched, and hoping that someone would find it useful and word would gradually spread.

I woke the next morning to find thousands of people were visiting the site already - creating, downloading, tweeting, emailing and sending in feedback. I was really impressed at the level of interest and the positive response. **Thank you to everyone who's helped get the word out about Studio Styles**, especially [Scott Hanselman](http://www.hanselman.com/).
 
To date the website's had 10,925 unique visitors, which has wildly exceeded my expectations (whatever they were). There are also some really, really ridiculously good-looking themes available now; some [old](http://studiostyl.esinfo/schemes/wekeroad-ink) [favourites](http://studiostyles.info/schemes/humane-studio), and heaps of [awesome](http://studiostyles.info/schemes/son-of-obsidian) [new](http://studiostyles.info/schemes/selenitic) [ones](http://studiostyles.info/schemes/hugoware). To me, just the fact that I have easy access to all these great themes makes the work totally worth it. **Thank you to everyone who's submitted a theme and made working in Visual Studio more fun.**
