If you're reading this blog, you probably already know that [Razor](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2010/07/02/introducing-razor.aspx) is the new view engine for ASP.NET. Studiostyles supports Razor syntax now—check out the growing list of [color schemes that have already been updated to support it](http://studiostyl.es/schemes/supporting/razor).

Authors can log in to update their existing color schemes – it's just one extra color setting to update. **If you're signing in with a Google Account**, you may find you can't access your original user account on Studiostyles – this seems to be due to the domain name change and will have to be resolved manually. Please email me (luke at studiostyles dot info) and let me know your scheme and the user account you end up with (e.g. user1234 at top right when you sign in).
